# Data Science Portfolio by Rishab Gupta

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and my projects which I completed to gain some hands-on experience in the data science domain.

### DataCamp

**1. Exploring 67 years of Lego** -
The project task was to explore the Lego sets that have ever been sold; the name of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. The skills used in this project are pandas and manipulating dataframes.

**2. Credit Card Applications** -
Manually analyzing the bank applications for credit card approval is mundane, error-prone and time consuming task. Using the power of machine learning, automated the credit card approval system for a commercial bank. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, Label Encoding, Standardizing features and Logistic Regression with an accuracy score of 83.7%.

**3. Classify song genres** -
Streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. Given the features like danceability, instrumentalness, energy, etc., the songs will be classifed into two categories, "Hip-Hop" and "Rock". The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, data cleaning, Standardizing features, PCA, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Cross Validation.

**3. Predict bee species from images** -
Can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? The project involved exploring the color channels, loading and processing the image data before feeding it to a machine learning algorithm. This project was completed to understand the working of images in Python and Machine Learning. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, PIL, HOGs, PCA and SVM.
