This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and my projects which I completed to gain some hands-on experience in the data science domain.


## Data Exploration and Analysis

**Exploring 67 years of Lego** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Exploring-67-years-of-lego)<br/>
The project task was to explore the Lego sets that have ever been sold; the name of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. The skills used in this project are pandas and manipulating dataframes.

## Classification problems

**1. Credit Card Applications** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Credit-Card-Applications)<br/>
Manually analyzing the bank applications for credit card approval is mundane, error-prone and time consuming task. Using the power of machine learning, automated the credit card approval system for a commercial bank. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, Label Encoding, Standardizing features and Logistic Regression with an accuracy score of 83.7%.

**2. Classify Song Genres** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Classify-Song-Genres)<br/>
Streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. Given the features like danceability, instrumentalness, energy, etc., the songs will be classifed into two categories, "Hip-Hop" and "Rock". The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, data cleaning, Standardizing features, PCA, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Cross Validation.

**3. Sentiment Analysis** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Sentiment-Analysis)<br/>
Given a word, the project would collect tweets and classify them as positive or negative. Seven classifiers were trained using a bag of words and a voting system was used to yield an efficient sentiment with high confidence level. The skills used in this project are: tweepy, NLP and scikit-learn classifiers.

## Regression problems

**The Professor Proposes** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/The-Professor-Proposes)<br/>
The professor wishes to buy a ring for his fiancee but is confronted by a dizzying array of diamond characteristics. The professor collects the diamond data and the task of the project is to analyze if the given quote on the ring professor selected is reasonable. The skills used in this project are: Predictive analytics, Model Building and Multiple Linear Regression.

## Image Prediction

**Predict Bee Species from Images** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Image-Prediction)<br/>
Can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? The project involved exploring the color channels, loading and processing the image data before feeding it to a machine learning algorithm. This project was completed to understand the working of images in Python and Machine Learning. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, data cleaning, data manipulation, PIL, HOGs, PCA and SVM.

## SQL

**Halifax Public Library SQL Application** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Halifax-Public-Library-PHP-SQL-Application)<br/>
The project was focused to improve the existing database design of the library. The library had three immediate plans: To record all articles for each magazine, to record transaction history, to record monthly expenses. A backend data management system was created using relational database structure. A front end system was created for library administrative staff. The skills used in this project are: SQL, MongoDB, RDBMS, Python, PHP.

## Recommendation System

**Netflix Recommendation** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Netflix-Prize)<br/>
The project aims to build a movie recommendation mechanism using Netflix's data. The program recommends new movies personalized to customers' taste, using their watch history. Moreover, given a movie name, the program also gives a list of similar movies that the user can watch. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, data cleaning, data manipulation and collaborative filtering (scikit-surprise).

## Tableau

**1. Vehicle Recommendation** - [Tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rishab.gupta#!/vizhome/RecommendationforVehiclePurchase/SCover)<br/>
A customer needs to buy a vehicle and they have specified a certain criteria that needs to be met. Using the data of cars available, the task was to come up with a recommendation for the vehicle that would best suit the customer's needs. The skills used in this project are: MS Excel, Data Analysis and Tableau.

**2. Payzant Home Hardware** - [Tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rishab.gupta#!/vizhome/HomeHardware3/Dashboard1)<br/>
Given the company's inventory data, the aim of this project was to optimize their inventory stratigies, thereby enhancing customer service and reducing lead time and costs. A time series forecasting model was developed in Tableau to predict the sales in the coming months for each category. The skills used in this project are: Time Series model, Tableau.

**3. Follow Rivers - Nova Scotia** - [Tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rishab.gupta#!/vizhome/FollowRivers-OpenData/Dashboard1)<br/>
It is highly important to preserve the nature and keeping a track of the chemical composition of the rivers is imperative. A data set of Nova Scotia rivers was used from the Open Data portal and visualized in Tableau, so the government can now publish annual reports used to influence regulations for industrial waste handling. The skills used in this project are: Data Analysis, Tableau

**4. UNB Data Visualization** - [github](https://github.com/rishabgupta94/Data-Visualization-UNB), [Competition link](http://unb.ca/data)<br/>
A national Data Visualization competition hosted by University of New Brunswick. With the power of open data and using the bicycle dataset, a recommendation was communicated on the idea to make Fredericton a less car relient city.

## Competitions and Hackathons

**1. International Business Analytics Challenge** - [iba](http://www.ibachallenge.org/)<br/>
The aim of the competition was to derive strategic business insights from the given AIESEC's data. The two main questions were answered: 1) How to increase the number of exchange opportunities posted by organizations? 2) How to increase the proportion of posted opportunities that find a suitable candidate. A recommendation system was built to improve the existing system for higher proportion of realizations.

**2. Halifax Innovation Challenge** - [innovation challenge](http://innovationchallenge.agendamanagers.ca/)<br/>
Awarded first prize for solving a real world problem and coming up with an innovative solution to help the current transportation problems of congestion, poor connectivity, time delays, etc. in Halifax.
