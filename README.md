# Data Science Portfolio by Rishab Gupta

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and my projects which I completed to gain some hands-on experience in the data science domain.

**1. Exploring 67 years of Lego** -
The project task was to explore the Lego sets that have ever been sold; the name of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. The skills used in this project are pandas and manipulating dataframes.

**2. Credit Card Applications** -
Manually analyzing the bank applications for credit card approval is mundane, error-prone and time consuming task. Using the power of machine learning, automated the credit card approval system for a commercial bank. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, Label Encoding, Standardizing features and Logistic Regression with an accuracy score of 83.7%.

**3. Classify song genres** -
Streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. Given the features like danceability, instrumentalness, energy, etc., the songs will be classifed into two categories, "Hip-Hop" and "Rock". The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, data cleaning, Standardizing features, PCA, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Cross Validation.

**4. Predict bee species from images** -
Can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? The project involved exploring the color channels, loading and processing the image data before feeding it to a machine learning algorithm. This project was completed to understand the working of images in Python and Machine Learning. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, data cleaning, data manipulation, PIL, HOGs, PCA and SVM.

**5. Netflix Recommendation** -
The project aims to build a movie recommendation mechanism using Netflix's data. The program recommends new movies personalized to customers' taste, using their watch history. Moreover, given a movie name, the program also gives a list of similar movies that the user can watch. The skills used in this project are: pandas, numpy, data cleaning, data manipulation and collaborative filtering (scikit-surprise).

**6. Sentiment Analysis** -
Given a word, the project would collect tweets and classify them as positive or negative. Seven classifiers were trained using a bag of words and a voting system was used to yield an efficient sentiment with high confidence level. The skills used in this project are: tweepy, NLP and scikit-learn classifiers.
